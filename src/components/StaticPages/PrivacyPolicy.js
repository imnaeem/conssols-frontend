            What is Conssols?
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Conssols is the best platform that helps customers to find the best
            construction company related to their projects. Simultaneously, it
            facilitates construction companies to find projects rapidly. This
            website can help both construction companies to meet on a single
            platform for their projects. Our website aims to create a platform
            for construction companies and clients who are looking to build
            house, or something related to construction. If you’re looking for
            construction services providers, it is difficult to find the best
            and nearby construction company. Clients can search for nearby
            companies based on ranking, location, rates, and building/house
            size. These service providers are already registered on this
            platform and clients can get rates from the companies they want.
            Another feature is that the customer can also post a request, and
            then the company will bid on the project and provide the customer
            with an estimated budget, duration, location, and service. Clients
            can also check the contact information of any company.
